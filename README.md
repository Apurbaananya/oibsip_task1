## Problem Statement:
The iris flower, scientifically called Iris, belongs to a unique genus of flowering plants. This genus includes three main species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. These species differ in physical characteristics, especially in sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that learns from iris flower measurements and accurately classifies them into their respective species. The primary aim is to automate the classification process based on the unique characteristics of each iris species.

Project Details:
- Iris Species: The dataset includes iris flowers from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- Key Measurements: The main characteristics for classification are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Machine Learning Model: The project involves developing and training a machine learning model to accurately classify iris flowers based on these measurements.

This project is significant as it can streamline and automate the classification of iris species, with potential applications in botany, horticulture, and environmental monitoring.
